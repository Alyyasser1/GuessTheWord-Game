Guess The Word Game

Guess The Word is a browser-based word puzzle game inspired by Wordle, built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden six-letter word within a limited number of attempts by entering one letter per input box.

Each guess provides visual feedback to guide the player:

Green indicates a correct letter in the correct position

Yellow indicates a correct letter in the wrong position

Gray indicates a letter that does not exist in the word

The game features a hint system, keyboard navigation, and custom backspace handling to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience similar to popular word-guessing games.
